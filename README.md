# RNA_Seq_Data_Analysis

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a powerful technology for transcriptome profiling. It allows us to investigate and discover the transcriptome, the total cellular content of RNAs including mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA4. Understanding the transcriptome is key if we are to connect the information in our genome with its functional protein expression.
The analysis of RNA-seq data typically consists of several key steps:
1. Quality check and preprocessing of raw sequence reads.
2. Mapping reads to a reference genome or transcriptome.
3. Counting reads mapped to individual genes or transcripts.
4. Identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes between different biological conditions.
5. Biological interpretation of DE genes and functional enrichment analysis.

RNA-seq has revolutionized the research communityâ€™s approach to studying gene expression. It has opened up the possibility of quantifying the expression level of all genes at once, allowing an ex-post (rather than ex-ante) selection of candidates that could be interesting for a certain study. This technology can detect alternative splicing isoforms and subtle changes in splicing under different conditions. The increased popularity of RNA-seq has led to a fast-growing need for bioinformatics expertise and computational resources. In order for bench scientists to correctly analyze and process large datasets, they will need to understand the bioinformatics principles and limitations that come with the complex process of RNA-seq analysis.

This project is designed for individuals interested in acquiring fundamental knowledge of RNA sequencing data analysis but lacking access to computational resources. The program can be executed using the Google Colaboratory Notebook platform.
